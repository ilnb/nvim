# README

These are my .config/nvim files for Neovim. I started with the [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/) distribution. Open to suggestions and improvements.

## A few things I like and have in my config

+ A [guide](https://coralpink.github.io/commentary/neovim/installation.html) (mostly JP, some EN) that walks you through configuring Neovim. Helps with Lua as well.
+ [Anime headers](https://github.com/nvimdev/dashboard-nvim/wiki/Ascii-Header-Text) which I use with the default dashboard in LazyVim, [snacks.nvim](https://github.com/folke/snacks.nvim).
+ My favourite themes: [material](https://github.com/marko-cerovac/material.nvim) and [kanagawa](https://github.com/rebelot/kanagawa.nvim). I also kinda like [tokyonight-dark](https://github.com/folke/tokyonight.nvim), and [catppuccin-frappe](https://github.com/catppuccin/nvim).
+ [Fzf-lua](https://github.com/ibhagwan/fzf-lua), a performant fuzzy finder. Snacks picker is also a good alternative.

### Enjoy the journey. Neovim :heart:
