# README
These are my .config/nvim files for Neovim. I started with the ![LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/) distribution. Open to suggestions and improvements.
## A few things I like and have in my config:
+ A ![guide](https://coralpink.github.io/commentary/wezterm/installation.html) to learn how to configure Neovim, and along with that, some Lua.
+ ![Anime headers](https://github.com/nvimdev/dashboard-nvim/wiki/Ascii-Header-Text) which I use with the default dashboard in LazyVim, ![snacks.nvim](https://github.com/folke/snacks.nvim).
+ My favourite themes: ![material](https://github.com/marko-cerovac/material.nvim) and ![kanagawa](https://github.com/rebelot/kanagawa.nvim). I also kinda like ![tokyonight-dark](https://github.com/folke/tokyonight.nvim).
+ Currently I'm using transparent material, along with wezterm with backdrops (![my config](https://github.com/ilnb/wezterm-config)).

### Enjoy the journey. Neovim :heart:
